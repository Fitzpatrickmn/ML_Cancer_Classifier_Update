Machine-Learning-Cancer-Classifier
Using Machine Learning for Cancer Diagnostics

Data Sets:

Numeric Values https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

Images https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images

The aim of this project is to compare machine learning models on numeric data vs images, to decide which tool has the highest accuracy in automated cancer classification.

For the image analysis of a Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC), the goal was to create a model that predicts whether the image represents cancerous cells (1) or non-cancerous cells (0).

For the numerical data, gathered through an analysis of a Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) of a breast masses, the predictor category is benign versus malignant, based on features such as the cell area, smoothness, texture, etc.

Currently, our numeric data classifier has an accuracy of ~96% (CSV Model) and our image classifier (Grayscale Model) has an accuracy of 85%.
